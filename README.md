# School District Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
The school board believes that a dataset shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. The school board doesn't know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, so they turn to Maria for help. Maria has asked me to conduct an analysis on the school districts math and reading scores.
